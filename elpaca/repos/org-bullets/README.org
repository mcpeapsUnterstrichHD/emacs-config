* About

  Show org-mode bullets as UTF-8 characters.

  *NOTE:* This is a legacy package maintained with a focus on
  preservation.  It has an unofficial successor package [[https://github.com/integral-dw/org-superstar-mode][org-superstar]]).
  This means that new features will no longer be added, and backwards
  compatibility will be preserved.

  It's unofficial successor package is available on MELPA.

* Installation

  Copy the file somewhere in your `load-path`, then add something like
  this to your init file.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'org-bullets)
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'org-bullets-mode)
  #+END_SRC

* FAQ / Troubleshooting
** "This mode causes significant slowdown!"
   I have looked into the matter [[https://github.com/integral-dw/org-superstar-mode/issues/3][in the past]], and from what I
   understand the usual cause of this is relates to a deeper rooted
   issue involving fonts and font-lock reliant packages.  I recommend
   adding the following to your =.emacs=:
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (setq inhibit-compacting-font-caches t)
   #+END_SRC
   or any more fancy variation thereof.  This variable also holds
   further information regarding what I believe is the cause of the
   problem.  If this should not fix the problem, please consider
   opening an issue or sending me a mail!
